## Software Design Patterns

###What is Software Design Patterns?
Software design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design, each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

There are about 23 design patterns but grouped into 3:
1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavioural

#### Creational:
Creational design pattern provide different object creation mechnisms, that could increase flexibility or reuse of existing code.
Below are examples of creational design patterns
##### Factory methods: 
this method provides an interface for creating objects in superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of object that will be created.
##### Abstract factory method: 
this method lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete class.
##### Builder: 
letâ€™s you construct objects step by step, this pattern allows you produce different types of representation of an object, using the same contruction code.
##### Prototype: 
this method lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their class.
##### Singleton: 
this lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
